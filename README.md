# Git Lesson - Structured Files

This lesson is divided into multiple markdown files, each offering a clear and organized path for learning Git. Below is a guide to the files and their contents, ordered by what should be read first.

## File Structure

1.  **read-before-class.md**

    - This file includes instructions on how to set up Visual Studio Code for the Git class by enabling the `code .` command on both Mac and Windows.
    - It serves as a precursor to the class, ensuring that students are ready to follow along with the examples and exercises in the Git class.
    - Topics covered:
      - Installing the `code .` command for VS Code on Mac and Windows
      - Configuring line endings for different operating systems
      - Why this setup is important for Git usage

2.  **git-explanations.md**

    - This file contains a detailed explanation of what Git is, how it works, and why it is essential for version control in software development.
    - Topics covered include:
      - Introduction to Git and version control
      - Key Git concepts such as commits, branches, and repositories
      - Basic Git commands and their usage

3.  **multi-branch-work.md**

    - This file dives deep into Git's multi-branch workflow and best practices for managing branches in your projects.
    - Topics covered include:
      - Recommended multi-branching strategy (e.g., using `main` and `dev` branches)
      - Best practices for branch naming conventions
      - How to work with feature, bugfix, and release branches
      - How to handle code reviews and merging strategies

4.  **git-commands.md**

    - This file contains a cheatsheet of useful Git commands to help students work more efficiently with Git.
    - Topics covered:
      - Essential Git commands for daily use (e.g., `add`, `commit`, `push`, `pull`)
      - Advanced Git commands (e.g., `rebase`, `stash`, `merge`)
      - Useful combinations and flags (e.g., `git log --oneline`, `git status -s`)
      - Best practices for commit messages using CRUD conventions

## How to Use This Lesson

1.  **Start by reading `read-before-class.md`** to ensure your development environment is properly set up for the Git class.
2.  **Refer to `git-explanations.md`** to get a solid foundation in Git concepts and commands.
3.  **Use `multi-branch-work.md`** to understand how to effectively manage multiple branches in a real-world Git workflow.
4.  **Consult `git-commands.md`** as a quick reference during and after the lesson to look up Git commands and best practices.
