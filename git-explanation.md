# Introduction to Git and Working with Git

#### **1\. Introduction to Git**

Git is the most widely used version control system in the world. It is essential for tracking changes to code and collaborating on projects with others. In this lesson, we will cover what Git is, how it works, and how to get started using Git to manage your projects effectively.

By the end of this lesson, you will understand:

- What Git is and why it's important.
- How to install and configure Git.
- How to use basic Git commands to track and manage changes.
- How to work with Git's branching and merging functionality for collaboration.

#### **2\. What is Git?**

Git is a distributed version control system that tracks changes in your project files. It allows multiple developers to collaborate on the same project without overwriting each other's work. Here are some key features of Git:

- **Version Control**: Git records the history of changes, allowing you to revert to previous versions of your project.
- **Collaboration**: Multiple team members can work on different parts of the project simultaneously.
- **Distributed System**: Every developer has a full copy of the repository, including its history, allowing work to continue even when offline.
- **Efficiency**: Git handles branching and merging quickly, making it highly effective for large projects.

Git enables you to manage your project's code efficiently and ensures that team members can collaborate effectively without losing any code or progress.

#### **3\. Installing and Configuring Git (15 minutes)**

To get started with Git, you need to install it on your computer. Instead of following different steps for each operating system, you can download Git directly from the official website:

1.  Go to <https://git-scm.com/downloads>.
2.  Select your operating system (Windows, macOS, Linux, or others).
3.  Follow the installation instructions provided for your specific platform.

Once installed, open a terminal (Command Prompt on Windows or Terminal on macOS/Linux) and configure Git with your name and email, which will be attached to your commits.

bash

Copy code

`git config --global user.name "Your Name"
git config --global user.email "you@example.com"`

Set your preferred text editor (e.g., Visual Studio Code) for writing commit messages:

```bash
`git config --global core.editor "code --wait"`
```

Finally, check your configuration to ensure everything is set up:

bash

Copy code

`git config --list`
